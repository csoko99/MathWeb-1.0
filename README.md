**MathWeb 1.0 – Simplex Method Web App**

ℹ️ About
This project is a web application implementing the Simplex algorithm, developed in collaboration with a classmate for the Operations Research course at university. It enables users to input and solve linear programming problems using the simplex method, all within a web-based interface.

👤 Role
I was responsible for developing the matrix input interface as well as implementing the output display of the results. This included creating a user-friendly input system for defining constraints and objective functions, and designing a clear, structured output to present the step-by-step results of the algorithm.

📚 Academic Context
- 🎓 Developed as part of coursework for the "Operations Research" subject
- 🤝 Team project with a fellow university student
- 🧮 Focused on applying mathematical optimization in a usable frontend environment

✨ Features
- 🧠 Solve linear programming problems using the Simplex Method
- 🔢 Input matrix-based data for constraints and objective function
- 📤 Output of calculated optimal solution (if feasible)

🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML5 – UI layout and form elements
- CSS3 – Basic styling and layout structure
- JavaScript – Simplex method logic and matrix manipulation
